Natter TODO

5.0 (Goal: PHP port, Codename "Transgression")
 - PHP framework
 - Move all .html files to .php
 - Control panel styles

5.6

 - Improved log browser.  Search by date, post content, username.  Post history by username.
 - Last second features, if anyone can come up with anything compelling.


6.0 (Goal: Production API, Codename "Danger")

 - Chat profile saving
 - Pink API draft

6.1
 - Pink adapters for v, In, pB, SM, OC?, eSi? (lol)

6.2

6.3

 - Chiffon related refactor into various components for release and non-release.
