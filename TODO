Natter TODO

5.1 (Codename: "Transgression")
 - Death to the White Flash.  Rebuild message frame to add posts via AJAX and
   polling rather than use meta refresh.  Evaluate continuing to write the
   messages.html file as a fallback for proxies / bots.
 - Chat roster for the right frame.  Presence API for proxies / bots.

5.2 (Codename: "Undermine")
 - Quick & dirty port of control panel and guard scripts to PHP

5.3
 - Refactor & cleanup from Port

5.4 (Codename: "Assassin")
 - Quick & dirty port of main chat script to PHP

5.5
 - Refactor & cleanup from Port
 - Split out HTML from code where needed

5.6 (Codename: "Assassout")
 - MySQL port
 - Postgres port
 - Store logs in database (MySQL & Postgres only?  Evaluate SQLite log browse / add performance for large logs.)
 - Improved log browser.  Search by date, post content, username.  Post history by username.
 - Last second features, if anyone can come up with anything compelling.
 - Ignore list? (session-based)  (Punted from 5.1)
 - Private whispers?  (Punted from 5.1)
