Natter Changelog

Version: 4.10.1
Date: April 28, 2009
 - MultiChat is finally here!  When enabled, users may switch between sets of
   post form data without needing to load multiple chat tabs or windows.
   Using a tab-like interface, users will be able to enter, switch between,
   and remove sets of names and colors, all from a single chat window.
 - Users can no logner manipulate the chat into posting extra "A user has
   entered the chat" messages.

Version: 4.10.0
Codename: Ingress
Date: April 23, 2009
 - Natter now requires Perl 5.8.  Nobody should realistically be running
   anything older than that in production.  Seriously, folks, upgrade.
 - The list of required non-standard Perl modules is now:
	- DateTime
	- DBI
	- DBD::SQLite
 - Natter now bundles the JSON Perl module from CPAN and uses JSON::PP.  This
   would be done with the others, however those require platform-specific binary
   modules.  While DBI::PP exists, DBD::SQLite::PP doesn't.  Thank goodness.
 - Massively overhauled the session system.
    - Now uses an SQLite database to store sessions.
    - Sessions can not be migrated.  Users will be kicked out after the upgrade
      and must re-enter the chat password and re-COPPA-ize.  Don't upgrade when
      people are using the chat, and they'll never notice.
    - Sessions are now 12 hours in length.  Users with a session cookie that
      return to the chat after more than 12 hours may be asked to re-enter.
    - All previous cookies have been retired in favor of the session cookie.
    - Bots and Proxies may be impacted.  See notes below.
 - Massively overhauled the ban system.
    - Now uses an SQLite database to store bans.
    - Migration of old bans will occur on the first login to the guard frameset.
    - Session bans are now recorded in the ban logs.
    - Session bans are now limited to 12 hours in length.
    - Lifted, cleared bans are no longer deleted from the ban log.  They may now
      be viewed by using links on the ban log page.
 - Refactored the internal script structures.  Script output is now done through
   a single established code path.  Output is now accompanied with extra
   informative HTTP headers.  This may help eliminate the "the server is telling
   me to download chat3.cgi" problem.
 - Bot and Proxy behavior may be impacted by this update.
    - The cookie changes may throw off code behavior.  If you have been looking
	  for and setting the individual "sanity", "COPPA", and "password" cookies,
	  you'll need to stop doing that.  Sanity state is kept in the session,
	  as is COPPA and password information.
	- Best practice would be to simply accept any cookie sent from the script.
	- Your code should post at least once an hour, if the user is inactive, to
	  maintain session activity.  A simple GET of action=post should work.


---- Older Versions ----


Version: 4.9.3
Date: April 15, 2009
 - Password option added.  The code now uses DBI, DBD::SQLite, and Digest::MD5
   The password is defined using the ChatPassword configuration setting.  Users
   will get three tries to log in.  You may change this number by altering the
   PasswordAttempts variable.  The password must be entered each time the user
   enters the chat, even if they have the password cookie.

Version: 4.9.2
Date: April 9, 2009
 - Cookie prefix is now seperate from script name, but defaults to the old script name.
   This should permit multiple instances of the script to share a domain without
   having to share the same sessions directory.
 - HTML color names (legal and broken) are now converted back to the name from the
   hex code when displaying the posting form.  In the event of multiple possible
   names ("grey" vs "gray"), the first name sorted alphabetically is picked, even
   if the user selected the other.
 - COPPA age is now configurable.  Set to zero to disable the COPPA check.  When
   disabled, the intro page instead reminds the users to read the rules.  The
   click-thru effect and URL are identical to the "over age" COPPA link, so Bots
   and Proxies should still continue to work.
 - Added configuration option to check the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header.
 - Added Http:BL support from Project Honeypot.  To enable,Â enter your API key in the config.
 - Added possible URL redirect upon kick/ban
 - Added checking for a local CSS file (local_style.css) to be included in the
   style output, which should make local customization easier.

Version: 4.9.1
Date: March 30, 2009
 - CSS PHP file split into three different versions for the three default color schemes
 - Lameness filter can now be disabled in configuration
 - Missing configuration values are now given default values
 - Added over five hundred "invalid" named HTML colors, such as "indianred1" to the color
   translation list.

Version: 4.9.0
Codename: Diaspora
Date: March 28, 2009
 - Major code cleanup, with numerous internal style fixes and additional code comments
 - Major CSS refactor
 - Major HTML refactor
 - CSS PHP file now emits proper caching headers to help reduce the "white flash" effect
 - All Javascript rewritten to take advantage of jQuery 1.3
 - [monger] markup code removed
 - Invalid HTML colors (i.e. "crap", "radioactive") are now transformed into legal hex colors using
   the pre-Mozilla Netscape formula.  Viewers should now always see the same color, regardless of
   browser.  The classic Netscape colors have been added to a translation list, so colors such as
   "aliceblue" will continue to work.


Version: 4.8

Version: 4.5

Date: Late Summer, 2002
 - CSS is now served by a PHP script instead of a CGI script for additional speed.  This should
   help reduce the "white flash" effect.
 - Lifted or expired bans are now listed as expired or lifted until they are deleted.  (The
   previous behavior was to hide the lifted or expired ban entirely.)
 - Guard logs added.  All messages to chat are now recorded, along with the poster's IP address,
   so Guards may review previous conversations.

Codename: Maquis
Date: c. 2001
