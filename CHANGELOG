Natter Changelog

Version: 4.9.2
Date: April 8, 2009
 - Cookie prefix is now seperate from script name, but defaults to the old script name.
   This should permit multiple instances of the script to share a domain without
   having to share the same sessions directory.
 - HTML color names (legal and broken) are now converted back to the name from the
   hex code when displaying the posting form.  In the event of multiple possible
   names ("grey" vs "gray"), the first name sorted alphabetically is picked, even
   if the user selected the other.
 - COPPA age is now configurable.  Set to zero to disable the COPPA check.  When
   disabled, the intro page instead reminds the users to read the rules.  The
   click-thru effect and URL are identical to the "over age" COPPA link, so Bots
   and Proxies should still continue to work.

Version: 4.9.1
Date: March 30, 2009
 - CSS PHP file split into three different versions for the three default color schemes
 - Lameness filter can now be disabled in configuration
 - Missing configuration values are now given default values
 - Added over five hundred "invalid" named HTML colors, such as "indianred1" to the color
   translation list.

Version: 4.9.0
Codename: Diaspora
Date: March 28, 2009
 - Major code cleanup, with numerous internal style fixes and additional code comments
 - Major CSS refactor
 - Major HTML refactor
 - CSS PHP file now emits proper caching headers to help reduce the "white flash" effect
 - All Javascript rewritten to take advantage of jQuery 1.3
 - [monger] markup code removed
 - Invalid HTML colors (i.e. "crap", "radioactive") are now transformed into legal hex colors using
   the pre-Mozilla Netscape formula.  Viewers should now always see the same color, regardless of
   browser.  The classic Netscape colors have been added to a translation list, so colors such as
   "aliceblue" will continue to work.
