Natter Changelog

Version: 4.10.0
Codename: Ingress
Date: April 17, 2009
 - Massively overhauled the session and ban system.  Sessions and bans now use
   an SQLite database via DBI and DBD::SQLite.
 - Bans will be migrated from the old Storable method after the first login to
   the guard frame.  The old sessions directory can be deleted after migration.
 - Sessions can not be migrated.  Users will be kicked from the chat during the
   upgrade, and must reload the chat frameset.
 - Session bans are now recorded and displayed on the ban list page.
 - Session bans are now limited to no more than 12 hours.  Attempting to set a
   longer ban on a session will cause it to be limited to 12 hours.
 - The "sanity", "COPPA", "b4nn4g3", and "password" cookies are no longer used.
   The single "session" cookie replaces them.  Bots and Proxies should not be
   affected by this, unless they were looking directly for those cookie names.
   If your Bot or Proxy was looking for those names, please refrain from looking
   for the "session" cookie, as this is bad practice, and the "session" cookie
   is unlikely to retain that exact name in the future.  The required procedure
   to enter the chat as a Bot or Proxy is still identical.

Version: 4.9.3
Date: April 15, 2009
 - Password option added.  The code now uses DBI, DBD::SQLite, and Digest::MD5
   The password is defined using the ChatPassword configuration setting.  Users
   will get three tries to log in.  You may change this number by altering the
   PasswordAttempts variable.  The password must be entered each time the user
   enters the chat, even if they have the password cookie.

Version: 4.9.2
Date: April 9, 2009
 - Cookie prefix is now seperate from script name, but defaults to the old script name.
   This should permit multiple instances of the script to share a domain without
   having to share the same sessions directory.
 - HTML color names (legal and broken) are now converted back to the name from the
   hex code when displaying the posting form.  In the event of multiple possible
   names ("grey" vs "gray"), the first name sorted alphabetically is picked, even
   if the user selected the other.
 - COPPA age is now configurable.  Set to zero to disable the COPPA check.  When
   disabled, the intro page instead reminds the users to read the rules.  The
   click-thru effect and URL are identical to the "over age" COPPA link, so Bots
   and Proxies should still continue to work.
 - Added configuration option to check the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header.
 - Added Http:BL support from Project Honeypot.  To enable,Â enter your API key in the config.
 - Added possible URL redirect upon kick/ban
 - Added checking for a local CSS file (local_style.css) to be included in the
   style output, which should make local customization easier.

Version: 4.9.1
Date: March 30, 2009
 - CSS PHP file split into three different versions for the three default color schemes
 - Lameness filter can now be disabled in configuration
 - Missing configuration values are now given default values
 - Added over five hundred "invalid" named HTML colors, such as "indianred1" to the color
   translation list.

Version: 4.9.0
Codename: Diaspora
Date: March 28, 2009
 - Major code cleanup, with numerous internal style fixes and additional code comments
 - Major CSS refactor
 - Major HTML refactor
 - CSS PHP file now emits proper caching headers to help reduce the "white flash" effect
 - All Javascript rewritten to take advantage of jQuery 1.3
 - [monger] markup code removed
 - Invalid HTML colors (i.e. "crap", "radioactive") are now transformed into legal hex colors using
   the pre-Mozilla Netscape formula.  Viewers should now always see the same color, regardless of
   browser.  The classic Netscape colors have been added to a translation list, so colors such as
   "aliceblue" will continue to work.
